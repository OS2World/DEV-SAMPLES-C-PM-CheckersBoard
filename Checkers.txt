Version:	0.20
----------------------------   

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This is a PM sample application that will generate a checkers board inside a PM window. 


REQUIREMENTS
------------
- yum install gcc libc-devel binutils kbuild-make

COMPILE INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------
This version of this sample was modified to compile on ArcaOS with GCC 9 compiler. 

1) Remember to have correct header files your path. For GCC the correct ones are the included on the "libc-devel", not the ones from the OS/2 Toolkit. Check your config.sys for "SET INCLUDE=C:\usr\include"

2) Since I'm using the Watcom Resource Compiler (open source) instead of the classic rc.exe, and the the Watcom Linker, intead of the classic ilink.exe, add to your config.sys...
 SET EMXOMFLD_LINKER=wl.exe
 SET EMXOMFLD_TYPE=WLINK
 SET EMXOMFLD_RC_TYPE=WRC
 SET EMXOMFLD_RC=wrc.exe

3) Run "nmake" or "nmake 2>&1 |tee make.out" to get the log file.

TOOLS USED
----------
- ArcaOS	- Verion 5.0.7
- gcc		- gcc (GCC) 9.2.0 20190812 (OS/2 RPM build 9.2.0-5.oc00)
- wl		- Watcom Linker
- wrc		- Watcom Resource Compiler
- make 		- Version 3.81 k2 (2017-11-10)

TROUBLESHOOT
------------
The compile produce will run by just executing "make" on the directory. If you want to save the log file you can run it as "make 2>&1 |tee make.out". The log will be saved into the "make.out" file.
